This project uses the face_recognition library in Python to find a celebrity look-alike from a picture that you upload.

The face_recognition library, which is built using dlib’s state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning, is considered one of the simples libraries used for face recognition and manipulation. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark. With this library you can find faces, find and manipulate facial features, and identify faces in pictures. You can also use this library with other Python libraries to do real-time face recognition.
Face Recognition
Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with
the world’s simplest face recognition library.
Built using dlib’s state-of-the-art face recognition
built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the
Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.
This also provides a simple face_recognition command line tool that lets
you do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line!
